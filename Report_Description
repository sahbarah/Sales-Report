In this report we want to know below information for every region:
- Total sales
- Total profit
- Average of sale
- Average of profit
- Number of products
- Number of cities
Then we want to see the sale for each year and quarter,I use line chart for it.
Using bar chart to show sale by product category.Also, show top 10 country by sale.Culomn chart.
then using donut chart to show profit by channel.

To be more accurate I add a tooltip that shows highest profit, profit by months and region.
